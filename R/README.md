This Folder contains Results from analyses. Short description of the files:<br><br>

**Phospho_Clusters.csv** <br>
Long format data file that contains information about the clusters modified peptides are associated with and the logFC of these at each time-point / Region

**PhosphoProteomics_Stats_AllContrasts.csv** <br>
Wide format data file (DEP output) that contains statistical results from contrasts (Homecage vs Swim) from the phospho analyses on the modified peptide level. contains p-values, fold changes and FDR adj p values for each  modified peptide in each contast

**Proteome_Stast_AllContrasts.csv** <br>
Long format data file with statistical results from the Control vs Swim contrast within individual sub-regions on the protein level.

**Proteome_Stats_RegionsSubregions.csv** <br>
Wide format data file with statistical results from the Region * SubRegion ANOVA analysis on the protein level

**SplicedvsUnspliced.csv** <br>
Wide format data file with statistical results from the processed (spliced) vs unprocessed (unspliced) analysis of sequencing data on the swim stress time series

**Transcriptome_Stats_AllContrasts.csv** <br>
Long format data with statistical results for contrasts (Swim vs Control) in the time-series analysis in both regions and each time-point on the transcriptome level

**Transcritpome_Clusters.csv** <br>
Long format data that contains information about the clusters transcripts are associated with and the logFC of these at each time-point / Region
